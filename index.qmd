title: "EBS Pollock Assessment Workflow"
---

# Overview

This site documents a year-structured workflow for updating assessment inputs,
running base and alternative model scenarios, and summarizing outputs.

# Yearly process

1. Create/update `YEAR/runs/data` (single annual input source).
2. Define scenarios in `YEAR/runs/<scenario>` with local `control.dat`.
3. Run scenarios in fixed order: base first, then alternatives.
4. Summarize outputs with `R/pmYY.R` and archive comparison tables.

# Commands

```bash
bash scripts/new_year_scaffold.sh 2026 2025
bash scripts/run_scenarios.sh 2025
Rscript R/pm25.R
```
